# Relational-Databases-Final-Project
While this isn't as interesting as my other projects, I decided to put this here to show that I can in fact write SQL. This was a group project and our final assessment for my relational databases class.

The goal here was to create our own database for a mock company of our choosing. The database was filled with mock data so that queries could be performed.
